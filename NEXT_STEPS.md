- âœ… Cleaned up data folder

#### 2. New Structure Created

  - Work Experience
  - Projects (with example entry)
  - Skills
  - Accomplishments & Awards
- âœ… All sections have placeholder text in `[brackets]` showing what to add
- âœ… Clean, professional design maintained from original template

#### 3. Support Files Added

## What You Need to Do Next

### Required Files:

1. **Profile Photo**
   - File: `images/profile.jpg` or `images/profile.png`
   - Size: 400x400px or larger, square format
   - Action: Replace `images/profile.svg`

2. **Resume/CV**
   - File: `data/AaravSinha-CV.pdf`
   - Action: Add your PDF resume to the data folder

3. **Project Images**
   - Files: `images/project1.jpg`, `images/project2.jpg`, etc.
   - Size: 800x600px or similar aspect ratio
   - Action: Add screenshots/images of your projects

### Content to Add (in `index.html`):

Edit the file and replace all text in `[brackets]` with your actual information:

- **Personal Bio** (lines 23-27)
  - Your title/role
  - Brief description of background
  - Current work/interests

- **Contact Links** (lines 30-35)
  - Email address
  - Google Scholar profile
  - Twitter/X profile
  - LinkedIn profile

- **Education** (lines 49-54)
  - Degrees obtained
  - Field of study
  - University names
  - Graduation years

- **Work Experience** (line 61)
  - Job titles
  - Companies
  - Duration
  - Key achievements

- **Projects** (starting around line 86)
  - Project titles
  - Descriptions
  - Technologies used
  - Links to code/demos
  - Copy the example project entry for each project

- **Skills** (lines 96-99)
  - Programming languages
  - Technologies & frameworks
  - Tools & platforms

- **Accomplishments** (lines 111-115)
  - Awards
  - Certifications
  - Notable achievements

## Testing Your Changes

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser to preview
2. Check all links work correctly
3. Verify images display properly
4. Test on mobile view (resize browser window)

## Optional Cleanup

The `images/` folder still contains ~200 old images from the original template that are no longer used. These don't affect the website but take up repository space. You can safely delete them (except `profile.svg`, `project1.svg`, and the `favicon/` folder) and replace with your own project images.

## Publishing

Once you've added your content:
1. Test locally
2. Commit your changes: `git add .` and `git commit -m "Add personal content"`
3. Push to GitHub: `git push`
4. Your site will be live at: https://aaravsinhaofficial.github.io

The website structure is ready - all that's needed now is your personal content to make it shine! ðŸš€
